This is a Sunday morning. Weather is clear.

I lie on the bed, read one aticle linked from hack news: [Successful People are successful](http://swombat.com/2012/3/10/successful-people)

This article is trying to say successful people usually have been successful before everybody knows that. Successful people always optimize personal growth for buidling their "success pool".

I cannot agree more. 

However, being successful is more than that.[One comment on hack news](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3688263) gives a very good point of view. We often ignore that chances play an essential role in everyone's success. If Steve Jobs was born in China, he would not create the great Apple. That's the simple truth.

I believe **LIFE IS A RANDOM GAME**. You may argue that hard working can change the fate. Yes. But hard working should also be seen as an attribute that is set in your body when you are born, and it is random. So a person is created with random attributes, and he will live with random chances happening around him. That's the game of life.
