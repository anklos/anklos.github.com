Assume you will go into two rooms:

Room A: full of latest cool staff like best cars, iphone 5, ipad 3, you name it. Things that contain and represent highest intelligence and creativity of hunman beings.

Room B: A girl, who you would fall in love at first sight. 

Which room would give you more inside happiness?

hmmm...

That's why Steve Jobs said his greatest achievement in his life is raise four kids.
